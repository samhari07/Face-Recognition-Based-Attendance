# Face-Recognition-Based-Attendance
# Abstract
The provided Python project aims to implement face recognition and attendance tracking using a webcam. It consists of three main parts: "Add face," "app face," and "test face." The "Add face" script captures facial images from the webcam, creating a dataset for training the face recognition model. The "app face" script generates a Streamlit web app that refreshes automatically, displaying counting results (FizzBuzz) and an attendance table with recognized faces and timestamps. The "test face" script utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm for real-time face recognition and updating attendance records. The project offers an accessible and efficient system for managing attendance through facial recognition.
# Introduction
The provided Python code presents a simple yet effective face recognition and attendance tracking system. It consists of three major components: "Add face," "App face," and "Test face." In the "Add face" script, the code captures facial images through the computer's webcam, creates a dataset of faces, and stores them in pickle files for future use. The "App face" script builds a Streamlit web application with auto-refresh capabilities, featuring a counter and a dynamic attendance table. Lastly, the "Test face" script implements real-time face recognition using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to match detected faces with the stored dataset. Once recognized, the system updates the attendance record with the individual's name and timestamp, which is then saved to a CSV file. This system offers a user-friendly and efficient solution for automated face recognition and attendance management, making it applicable in various settings like classrooms, offices, or events. 
# Problem Statement
The problem is to develop a real-time face recognition and attendance management system using computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms. The system should be able to capture face images from the webcam, detect and crop faces using Haar cascades, and save these images along with corresponding labels. Then, a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model should be trained on the collected face data. The system should continuously process live video feed, perform face recognition using the trained KNN model, and display the recognized person's name on the screen in real-time. Additionally, the system should allow users to record attendance by pressing a specific key, which logs the recognized person's name and timestamp in a CSV file named "Attendance_" followed by the current date. Finally, a Streamlit web application should be created to display the attendance data in a tabular format for the current date.
